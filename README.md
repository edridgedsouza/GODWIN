Godwin's Law states that, "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1." Of course the laws is meant, as Godwin explained, "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of mathematics, its purpose has always been rhetorical and pedagogical: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler or to Nazis to think a bit harder about the Holocaust."
